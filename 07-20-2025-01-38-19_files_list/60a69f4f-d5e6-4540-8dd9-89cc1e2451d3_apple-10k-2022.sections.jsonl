The iPad line includes iPad Pro\u00ae, \niPad Air\u00ae, iPad and iPad mini\u00ae.\nWearables, Home and Accessories\nWearables, Home and Accessories includes:\n\u2022\nAirPods\u00ae, the Company\u2019s wireless headphones, including AirPods, AirPods Pro\u00ae and AirPods Max\u2122;\n\u2022\nApple TV\u00ae, the Company\u2019s media streaming and gaming device based on its tvOS\u00ae operating system, including Apple \nTV 4K and Apple TV HD;\n\u2022\nApple Watch\u00ae, the Company\u2019s line of smartwatches based on its watchOS\u00ae operating system, including Apple Watch \nUltra\u2122, Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch SE\u00ae; and\n\u2022\nBeats\u00ae products, HomePod mini\u00ae and accessories.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 1\n\nServices\nAdvertising\nThe Company\u2019s advertising services include various third-party licensing arrangements and the Company\u2019s own advertising \nplatforms.\nAppleCare\nThe Company offers a portfolio of fee-based service and support products under the AppleCare\u00ae brand. The offerings provide \npriority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement \nservices, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage and/or theft and loss, depending on the \ncountry and type of product.\nCloud Services\nThe Company\u2019s cloud services store and keep customers\u2019 content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and \nWindows personal computers.\nDigital Content\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store\u00ae, that allow customers to discover and download applications \nand digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts.\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade\u00ae, a game subscription \nservice; Apple Fitness+SM, a personalized fitness service; Apple Music\u00ae, which offers users a curated listening experience with \non-demand radio stations; Apple News+\u00ae, a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+\u00ae, which offers exclusive \noriginal content and live sports.\nPayment Services\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card\u00ae, a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay\u00ae, a cashless payment \nservice.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Company\u2019s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government \nmarkets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, \nsmall and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its \ndirect sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network \ncarriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2022, the Company\u2019s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution \nchannels accounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price \ncompetition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short \nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid \nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of \nthe Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating \nthe Company\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative \nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for \nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal \ncompetitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative \nprice and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and \naccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 2\n\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables \nand accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have \nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings \nwith large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products \nand a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut \nprices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products \nat little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company\u2019s services compete with business models that provide content to users for \nfree and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition \nas competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated \nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain \ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with \nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the \nCompany will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in \nAsia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u2019s \nability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, \nservices and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing \nproducts and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d), licensing of \nintellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, \naccessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual \nproperty rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual \nproperty rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, \nthe Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, \ndevelopment, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the \nCompany has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single \nintellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\u2019s products and services. The Company believes the \nduration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include \nintellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various \naspects of the Company\u2019s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such \nlicenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future \non reasonable terms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 3\n\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \nsales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect \ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an \nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and \ndistributors anticipate a product introduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive \nenvironment for all of its team members. As of September\u00a0 24, 2022, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time \nequivalent employees.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of \nharassment or discrimination.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the \nCompany\u2019s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their \nneeds and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide \nvariety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees\u2019 \nindividual growth and development.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Company remains committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the \ncommunities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive \nculture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\nEngagement\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an \nopen, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to \ncome to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee \nsentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace \nrisks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security \nand crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard \nenvironments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers \nthrough its global security team. The Company has also taken additional health and safety measures during the COVID-19 \npandemic.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company\u2019s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and \namendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \n\u201cExchange Act\u201d), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d).

{"section": "ITEM 1A.", "text": "Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of \nfactors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize \nfrom time to time, the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially \nand adversely affected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, \npast financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not \nuse historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking \nstatements.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition \nand Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial \nStatements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and \nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial \ncondition.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales. \nIn addition, the Company\u2019s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\u2019s supplier facilities, including \nmanufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\u2019s operations and performance depend \nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to \ntrade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations \ncan adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products \nand services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to financial \nmarket volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, \nenergy shortages and cost increases, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors. \nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\u2019s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional \neconomic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, \ndistributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain \ncredit to finance operations and purchases of the Company\u2019s products; and insolvency.\nA downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019s trade \nreceivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to issue \nnew debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial instruments. These and other economic \nfactors can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price have been adversely affected and \ncould in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID-19 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to \ntake unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, \ntemporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times \nsignificantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the \nfuture materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. During the \ncourse of the pandemic, certain of the Company\u2019s component suppliers and manufacturing and logistical service providers have \nexperienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide, and similar disruptions could occur in the \nfuture. Public safety measures can also adversely impact consumer demand for the Company\u2019s products and services in \naffected areas.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 5\n\nThe Company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and \nrequirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company\u2019s operational and \nfinancial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company\u2019s control, including the timing, \nextent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and \neffectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on \nthe global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include \nmaterial adverse effects on demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, the Company\u2019s supply chain and sales and \ndistribution channels, the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company\u2019s profitability and cost structure.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and \nstock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company\u2019s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, \nnatural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents \nand other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material \nadverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular \nnetwork carriers and other channel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales, \nand the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s \nmanufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, \nJapan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, \nsanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, \nparticularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has \nsignificant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being \nimposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the \nCompany\u2019s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely \nimpact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company\u2019s products more expensive \nfor customers, which could make the Company\u2019s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also \nadopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the \nCompany\u2019s operations and supply chain and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer its products and services as designed. These \nmeasures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, \nand ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company\u2019s operations in accordance with new or \nchanged trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations. Such restrictions can \nbe announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from \nsuch measures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly \nmore severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade \nand other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely \naffect the Company\u2019s business.\nMany of the Company\u2019s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract \nmanufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and \nfacilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial \naccidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health \nissues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Global climate \nchange is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can \nmake it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and \ninefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service \nofferings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant \nexpenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the \nsupply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any \nnegative consequences to the Company.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 6\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While \nthe Company\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur \nand could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company\u2019s business, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. \nMajor public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the \nfuture materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; \nthe imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight \nservices and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\u2019s supply chain and sales and \ndistribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to \ncover all losses that may arise.\nGlobal markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological \nchange, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price \ncompetition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short \nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid \nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative \nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for \nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the \nCompany must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected \nreturns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to \nregister, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete \nprimarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on \nits\u00a0 intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the \nCompany operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if \ncompetitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be \nmaterially adversely affected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces \nsubstantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other \nresources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the \nCompany\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. \nCompetition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain \ncompetitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of \nthe markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications \nwithin their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also \nexpects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their \nofferings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Company\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and \nexperience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models \nthat provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content \nand applications.\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company\u2019s ability to \ncontinually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the \nCompany will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 7\n\nBusiness Risks\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions \nand transitions of products and services.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company \nmust continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively \nstimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new \nand upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, \nincluding timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with \nproduction ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company\u2019s products, the effective management of \npurchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate \nquantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or \nother defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and \ntransitions of products and services.\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing \npartners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in \nAsia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this \nmanufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions \nto the Company\u2019s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The \nCompany has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower \noperating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has \nfrom time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services \nprovided, or adversely affect the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these \npartners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the \nconsumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect \nliabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the \nsupplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results \nof operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many \ncomponents, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s \nhardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of \ncomponents or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be \ndisrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial \ndisputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade \ndisputes.\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, \nand has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements \nhelp ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial \nproblems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of \nmanufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on \ncommercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant \nsupply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to \nindustry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s \nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high \ndemand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could materially adversely affect, the Company\u2019s ability to \nobtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has \nentered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or \nrenew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can \nlead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain \nsufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic \nconditions on the Company\u2019s suppliers, described in \u201cThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on \nglobal and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s \nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition,\u201d above, can also affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components. \nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially \nadversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 8\n\nThe Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product \nuses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing \ncapacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any \nnumber of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components \ncustomized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. When the Company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product has \nbeen delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the \nCompany\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints \ncould materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s business \nand financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient \nquantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could \nmaterially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing \ndefects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues \nthat can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in \ncomponents and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company\u2019s products \nunsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company\u2019s \nproducts are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company\u2019s service offerings can have \nquality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company\u2019s services from \ntime to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the \nCompany will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can \nresult in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, the Company \ncan be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant \nand equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory \nfines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in \nharm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and \nservices, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase \ncommitment cancellation risk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated \ndemand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for \norders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its \nsuppliers\u2019 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be \nrecoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which \nthe carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory \nprepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company \nwill not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence \nin the industries in which the Company competes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. \nManufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for \nperiods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u2019s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price \nchanges, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components \nor products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on \ncommercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires \nlicenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently \ncompetes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the \nCompany\u2019s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to \ntime, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. \nBased on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally \nbe obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on \ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such \nintellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or \notherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 9\n\nThe Company\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party \nsoftware applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain \nsoftware applications and services for the Company\u2019s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be \ndeveloped and maintained for the Company\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u2019s products.\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the \ndevelopers\u2019 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services \nfor the Company\u2019s products compared to competitors\u2019 platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for \npersonal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on \nfactors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected \nfuture growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\nThe Company\u2019s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers \nless inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u2019s products and more inclined to devote their resources to \ndeveloping and upgrading software for competitors\u2019 products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on \nthese competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u2019s devices can suffer.\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its \nproducts. The Company\u2019s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party \ndevelopers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these \nchanges to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can result in dissatisfied customers.\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, \ndevelopers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission from sales of \napplications and sales of digital services or goods within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to \nits App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further \nbusiness changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Digital Markets Act, could require \nfurther changes. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in \nchanges to the Company\u2019s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how \nand to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the \nApp Store. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. \nIf the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or \neliminated, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company\u2019s customers, or to make such content available \non commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of \noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or \noffer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company\u2019s own services. \nThe licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the \ncontinuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers \nand distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or \nimpossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may \nseek to limit the Company\u2019s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a \nwide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for \ntalent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company\u2019s customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused \nadditional restrictions on production and increased costs for digital content.\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. \nIf requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be \nno assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 10\n\nThe Company\u2019s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and \navailability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company\u2019s ability to nurture its distinctive and \ninclusive culture.\nMuch of the Company\u2019s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued availability and \nservice of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced \npersonnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, \nwhere most of the Company\u2019s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are \nconstantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely \naffect the Company\u2019s culture, reputation and operational flexibility.\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to \nnurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who \nare critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of \noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and \nresellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services \nand resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and \neducation, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company\u2019s products offer financing, installment payment plans or \nsubsidies for users\u2019 purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same \namounts.\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected \nresellers\u2019 stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can \nrequire a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could \nweaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\u2019s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the \nCompany\u2019s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\u2019s products.\nThe Company\u2019s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network \ndisruptions.\nThe Company and its global supply chain are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused \nby natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, \nphysical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy \nand other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 business continuity and \ndisaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the \nCompany\u2019s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company\u2019s online services, interfering with customer \ntransactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company\u2019s products. These events could materially adversely \naffect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject \nthe Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\nThe Company\u2019s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the \nCompany\u2019s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including \nthrough the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot \nprovide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially \nadversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company \nrelies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. \nAlthough the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on \nthe Company\u2019s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential \ninformation occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, \nreputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 11\n\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. \nThese attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal \nbusiness operations, and could, among other things, impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers for its products \nand services, impact the Company\u2019s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to \nlitigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks \nare expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques \nthat are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the \nCompany\u2019s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers \ncan escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many \ncompanies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and \nthe value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent \nunauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of \nencryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all \neventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty \npassword management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 \nemployees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for \nunauthorized access to the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the \nCompany deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for \nunusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or \nloss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company\u2019s products and services.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such \ninsurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business, present risks not \noriginally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and \nfinancial condition.\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may \ninvolve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected \nliabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, \nregions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-\noffs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory \napprovals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from \ncompleting a transaction or otherwise limit the Company\u2019s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These \nnew ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely \naffect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of \nresources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company\u2019s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information \nsystems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain \nstores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique \ndesign elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company\u2019s more typical retail \nstores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company\u2019s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor \nperformance of an individual store or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and \nseverance costs.\nThe Company\u2019s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the \nCompany\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse \neffect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company\u2019s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store \nconstruction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the \nvalue of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 12\n\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable \nresults of legal proceedings or government investigations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary \ncourse of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements \nentered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and \ndamages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government \ninvestigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, \nhas generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and \nnew claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents \nand seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual \nproperty rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as \ninternationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be \nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company \nmay enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance \nsuch agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly \nincrease the Company\u2019s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and \nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services.\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form \n10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d under the heading \n\u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a \nmaterial loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other \nclaims.\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against \nthe Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s \nresults of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an \noutcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, \nremedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and can require the Company to change its business \npractices and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the \nCompany\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to \ncover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to \npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; \nprivacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services \nand technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; internet, telecommunications, \nand mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and \nservices; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation \nrestrictions; anti\u2013money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including \nelectronic waste, recycling, and climate change.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 13\n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely \naffect the Company\u2019s business by increasing the Company\u2019s costs, limiting the Company\u2019s ability to offer a product, service or \nfeature to customers, impacting customer demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, and requiring changes to the \nCompany\u2019s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such \nlaws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company\u2019s products and \nservices are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented \npolicies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the \nCompany\u2019s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies and \nprocedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s \nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially \nadversely affect the Company\u2019s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able \nto effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations \nrelating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are \ndesigned to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in \npreventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company\u2019s products could be delayed or prohibited from \nimportation, either of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and \nfinancial condition.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose the Company to potential \nliabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business. \nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on \nenvironmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas \nemissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its \nenvironmental, social and governance goals and initiatives through its environmental, social and governance report, its other \nnon-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these \nenvironmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and \nuncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company\u2019s \ncontrol. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and \ninitiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company\u2019s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived \nfailure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or \ninternational environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations \nand standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the \nCompany\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory \nscrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties. \nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market \nand legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the EU \nDigital Markets Act, or similar laws in other jurisdictions, could require further changes. These changes could include how and to \nwhat extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App \nStore.\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in \nlegal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact \non the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of \ninvestigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse \nfindings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its \nApp Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial \ncondition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company\u2019s \nbusiness practices, and may in the future result in further changes.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become \nsubject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the \nCompany\u2019s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, \nresults of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other \ncompanies to offer their search services on the Company\u2019s platforms and apps, and certain of these arrangements are currently \nsubject to government investigations and legal proceedings.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 14\n\nThere can be no assurance the Company\u2019s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by \nthe outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company\u2019s \nbusiness practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively \nimpact the reputation of the Company\u2019s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users \nof the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor \nmarket acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations \nregarding data protection.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of \nvarious types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict \ntransfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws \nin this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These \nlaws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing \nrequirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to \nchange its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information \nprovided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to \ncomply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations \ncould result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational \nimpacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the \nCompany is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health \ndata, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach \nnotification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company\u2019s compliance \nwith these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial \ndata is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company\u2019s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, \nthe Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, \nand can also incur significant fees or fines.\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder \ninformation is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur \nsignificant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also \nexperience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow \npayment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, \nresults of operations and financial condition.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company\u2019s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, \nthe gross margins on the Company\u2019s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company\u2019s gross \nmargins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global \nproduct pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased \ncompetition; the Company\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product \nlife cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, \nacquiring and delivering content for the Company\u2019s services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs \neffectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that \nregulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; \ninflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or \nservices with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of \noperations and financial condition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \nsales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a \ndecline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to \nunexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products or services, issues with new \nproduct or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the \nCompany\u2019s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 15\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative \nto local currencies.\nThe Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated \nsales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on \nproducts that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency \nexchange rate fluctuations.\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign \ncurrency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing \ndemand for the Company\u2019s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to \nraise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross \nmargins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales.\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019s foreign \ncurrency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its \nforeign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may \nincrease the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to \nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more \nthan a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the \nhedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and \neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of \nthe Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, \nalthough the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable \nsecurities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the \nCompany\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments \nrelated to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, \nretailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and \neducation, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not \ncovered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the \nCompany\u2019s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\u2019s exposure to \ncredit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks \nmay be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by \noutsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In \naddition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory \ncomponents. As of September\u00a024, 2022, the Company\u2019s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term \nsupply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has \nprocedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term \nprepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to \nadditional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the \nCompany\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and \nother non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates are \naffected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax \nassets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and \nIreland. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 16\n\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service \nand other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome \nresulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the \noutcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the \nultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s \nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nGeneral Risks\nThe price of the Company\u2019s stock is subject to volatility.\nThe Company\u2019s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, \nthe Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price \nand volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating \nperformance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to \nexceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future \ngrowth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will \ncontinue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are \nsubject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and the Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it \nto acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, \ndividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company\u2019s stock may decline significantly, which \ncould have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.", "page_range": [3, 8], "cross_references": [{"source_text": "Note 10", "target_section": "10", "position": 48537, "context": "the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d under the headin"}]}

The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global \neconomic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets.

The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2021 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due \nprimarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and foreign-derived \nintangible income deductions.\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2022 was higher compared to 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax rate on foreign \nearnings, including the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of regulatory guidance issued by the U.S. Department of the \nTreasury in 2022, and lower tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income deductions and share-based compensation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $156.4\u00a0billion \nas of September\u00a024, 2022, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be \nsufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.\nThe Company\u2019s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations.\nDebt\nAs of September\u00a024, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal \namount of $111.8 billion (collectively the \u201cNotes\u201d), with $11.1 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments \nassociated with the Notes total $41.3 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months.\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (\u201cCommercial Paper\u201d) pursuant to a commercial paper \nprogram.

The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide \nvariety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information \nsupplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of September\u00a0 24, 2022, the Company had \nmanufacturing purchase obligations of $71.1 billion, with $68.4 billion payable within 12 months. The Company\u2019s manufacturing \npurchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.\nOther Purchase Obligations\nThe Company\u2019s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including \nassets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to internet services and content creation.

As of September\u00a0 24, 2022, the \nCompany\u2019s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, \nsubject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles \n(\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the Company\u2019s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s \nmanagement to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant \nAccounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the \nsignificant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. \nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under \nthe circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company\u2019s \nuncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and \ninternational tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. \nAlthough management believes the Company\u2019s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of \nthese uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company\u2019s reserves. Reserves are adjusted \nconsidering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a \nmanner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and \noperating results.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of \nwhich are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount \nis reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner \ninconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating \nresults.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 25", "page_range": [3, 23], "cross_references": [{"source_text": "Note 11", "target_section": "11", "position": 6202, "context": "the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, \u201cSegment Information and Geographic \nData.\u201d\nThe "}, {"source_text": "Note 1", "target_section": "1", "position": 15894, "context": "s and estimates that affect the amounts reported.

{"section": "ITEM 7A.", "text": "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone \nbasis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the \nCompany\u2019s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions \nwill offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. \nFurther, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses \nrelated to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and \noperating results.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and outstanding \ndebt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, it is most affected by fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. \nChanges in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and \nthe fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company\u2019s debt.\nThe Company\u2019s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company\u2019s liquidity \nrequirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and \nachieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of \nminimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company\u2019s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment \ngrade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk \nassociated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a \nchange in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield \ncurve. Based on investment positions as of September\u00a0 24, 2022 and September\u00a0 25, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point \nincrease in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market \nvalue of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\nAs of September\u00a024, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes and as of September\u00a025, 2021, the Company had \noutstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $110.1 billion and $118.7 \nbillion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk \non its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate \npayments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the \ncorresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would \ncause interest expense on the Company\u2019s debt as of September\u00a024, 2022 and September\u00a025, 2021 to increase by $201 million \nand $186 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\nForeign Currency Risk\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and \nin particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in \nU.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there \nhas been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign \nexchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future \ncash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into \nforeign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency\u2013denominated \ndebt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue \nand inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign \nexchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging \nparticular exposures.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 26\n\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative \npositions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to assess the potential impact of \nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random \nmarket price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given \nconfidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model \nis not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm \ncommitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of \nthe model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $1.0 billion as of \nSeptember\u00a024, 2022, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September\u00a025, 2021. Because the \nCompany uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are \ngenerally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ \nmaterially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September\u00a0 24, 2022 due to the inherent limitations associated with \npredicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company\u2019s actual \nexposures and positions.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 27", "page_range": [3, 29], "cross_references": []}

Statements\nNote 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively \u201cApple\u201d \nor the \u201cCompany\u201d). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated \nfinancial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires \nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from \nthose estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been \nreclassified to conform to the current period\u2019s presentation.\nThe Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is \nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which will \noccur in the first quarter of the Company\u2019s fiscal year ending September 30, 2023. The Company\u2019s fiscal years 2022, 2021 and \n2020 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the \nCompany\u2019s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nRevenue Recognition\nNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue \nat the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is \ngenerally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of \nownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\u2019s Products net sales, control \ntransfers when products are shipped. For the Company\u2019s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are \ndelivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or \ncommencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer \nincentive programs based on the Company\u2019s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the \nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d). \nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are \nestablished that reflect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they \nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\u2019s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers \nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation \nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, \nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, \nMac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated \nsales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to \nreceive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud\u00ae, Siri\u00ae and Maps. The third performance obligation is the \nright to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with \neach device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative \nSSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is \nbased on the Company\u2019s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized \nwhen control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the \nproduct-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis \nover the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, \nincluding estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled \nservices and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For \nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that \nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized \nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 34\n\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the \nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when \ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, \nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party \napplications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company\u2019s other digital content stores, the \nCompany does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such \nsales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\nThe Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the \ncollected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on \nthe date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. \nFurther information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, \u201cBenefit Plans.\u201d\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (net income in \nmillions and shares in thousands):\n2022\n2021\n2020\nNumerator:\nNet income\n$ \n99,803 \n$ \n94,680 \n$ \n57,411 \nDenominator:\nWeighted-average basic shares outstanding\n \n16,215,963 \n \n16,701,272 \n \n17,352,119 \nEffect of dilutive securities\n \n109,856 \n \n163,647 \n \n176,095 \nWeighted-average diluted shares\n \n16,325,819 \n \n16,864,919 \n \n17,528,214 \nBasic earnings per share\n$ \n6.15 \n$ \n5.67 \n$ \n3.31 \nDiluted earnings per share\n$ \n6.11 \n$ \n5.61 \n$ \n3.28 \nThe Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities.\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.\nThe Company\u2019s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The \nCompany classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument\u2019s underlying \ncontractual maturity date.\nThe Company\u2019s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and their \navailability for use in current operations.\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\nInventories\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 35\n\nRestricted Marketable Securities\nThe Company considers marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The \nCompany reports restricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance \nSheets based on the classification of the underlying securities.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, \nwhich for buildings is the shorter of 40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one and five years for machinery and \nequipment, including manufacturing equipment; and the shorter of the lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. \nCapitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the \nassets, which range from five to seven years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment was $8.7 \nbillion, $9.5 billion and $9.7 billion during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nAll derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative \ngains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation.\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred \nin accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (\u201cAOCI\u201d) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged \ntransaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For options designated as \ncash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it on a \nstraight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates. \nChanges in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other \ncomprehensive income/(loss) (\u201cOCI\u201d).\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in \nthe Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to \nthe change in value of the hedged item. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company \nexcludes the forward carry component from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it in other income/(expense), \nnet (\u201cOI&E\u201d) on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the \nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.\nGains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges \nare recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which the derivative instruments relate.\nThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The \nCompany classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash \nFlows.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair values of the Company\u2019s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in \nactive markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company\u2019s debt instruments \nand all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market \nprices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings \ncreated by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cAct\u201d).\nLeases\nThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, \ndata center and retail facilities. The discount rates related to the Company\u2019s lease liabilities are generally based on estimates of \nthe Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company\u2019s leases cannot be readily determined.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 36\n\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company reports segment information based on the \u201cmanagement\u201d approach. The management approach designates the \ninternal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company\u2019s \nreportable segments.\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the \nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe \nincludes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong \nand Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company\u2019s other reportable \nsegments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is \nmanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market \ndynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described \nelsewhere in this Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for \ngeographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company\u2019s retail stores located in \nthose geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and \noperating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment \nin which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain \nexpenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate \nexpenses such as research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation \nexpenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The \nCompany does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\nNote 2 \u2013 Revenue\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n2022\n2021\n2020\niPhone (1)\n$ \n205,489 \n$ \n191,973 \n$ \n137,781 \nMac (1)\n \n40,177 \n \n35,190 \n \n28,622 \niPad (1)\n \n29,292 \n \n31,862 \n \n23,724 \nWearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2)\n \n41,241 \n \n38,367 \n \n30,620 \nServices (3)\n \n78,129 \n \n68,425 \n \n53,768 \nTotal net sales (4)\n$ \n394,328 \n$ \n365,817 \n$ \n274,515 \n(1)\nProducts net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in \nthe sales price of the respective product.\n(2)\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod \nmini and accessories.\n(3)\nServices net sales include sales from the Company\u2019s advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and other \nservices. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain \nproducts.\n(4)\nIncludes $7.5 billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\u00a025, 2021, $6.7 \nbillion of revenue recognized in 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\u00a026, 2020, and $5.0 billion of \nrevenue recognized in 2020 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\u00a028, 2019.\nThe Company\u2019s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment \nin Note 11, \u201cSegment Information and Geographic Data\u201d for 2022, 2021 and 2020, except in Greater China, where iPhone \nrevenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales in 2022 and 2021.\nAs of September\u00a024, 2022 and September\u00a025, 2021, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.4 billion and $11.9\u00a0billion, \nrespectively. As of September\u00a024, 2022, the Company expects 64% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, \n27% within one-to-two years, 7% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 37\n\nNote 3 \u2013 Financial Instruments\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nThe following tables show the Company\u2019s cash, cash

\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. \nHowever, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations \nor the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a \nportion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, \noption contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally \nhedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to \n12 months.\nTo protect the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency \nexchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company \ndesignates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September\u00a024, 2022, the maximum length of time \nover which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt\u2013related foreign currency \ntransactions is 20 years.\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins \nfrom certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains \nand losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company\u2019s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into \ninterest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value \nhedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Company\u2019s outstanding derivative instruments as of September\u00a024, 2022 and September\u00a025, 2021 \nwere as follows (in millions):\n2022\n2021\nDerivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts\n$ \n102,670 \n$ \n76,475 \nInterest rate contracts\n$ \n20,125 \n$ \n16,875 \nDerivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts\n$ \n185,381 \n$ \n126,918 \nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 39\n\nThe gross fair values of the Company\u2019s derivative assets and liabilities as of September\u00a024, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\n2022\nFair Value of\nDerivatives Designated\nas Accounting Hedges\nFair Value of\nDerivatives Not Designated\nas Accounting Hedges\nTotal\nFair Value\nDerivative assets (1):\nForeign exchange contracts\n$ \n4,317 \n$ \n2,819 \n$ \n7,136 \nDerivative liabilities (2):\nForeign exchange contracts\n$ \n2,205 \n$ \n2,547 \n$ \n4,752 \nInterest rate contracts\n$ \n1,367 \n$ \n\u2014 \n$ \n1,367 \n(1)\nDerivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-\ncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(2)\nDerivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-\ncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe derivative assets above represent the Company\u2019s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate \ncredit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted \nwhen the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the \nCompany generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company\u2019s derivative \ncontracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. \nAs of September\u00a024, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company\u2019s derivative contracts, \nincluding the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting \nin a net derivative asset of $412 million.\nThe carrying amounts of the Company\u2019s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September\u00a024, 2022 and September\u00a025, 2021 \nwere as follows (in millions):\n2022\n2021\nHedged assets/(liabilities):\nCurrent and non-current marketable securities\n$ \n13,378 \n$ \n15,954 \nCurrent and non-current term debt\n$ \n(18,739) $ \n(17,857) \nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, \nresellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does \nnot require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain \ninstances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit \ninsurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-\nfinancing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company \ngenerally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\nAs of September\u00a024, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which \naccounted for 10%. The Company\u2019s cellular network carriers accounted for 44% and 42% of total trade receivables as of \nSeptember\u00a024, 2022 and September 25, 2021, respectively.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to \nthese vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these \ncomponents directly from suppliers. As of September\u00a024, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% \nor more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 13%. As of September\u00a025, 2021, the Company had \nthree vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 52%, 11% \nand 11%.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 40\n\nNote 4 \u2013 Consolidated Financial Statement Details\nThe following tables show the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statement details as of September\u00a024, 2022 and September\u00a025, \n2021 (in millions):\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\n2022\n2021\nLand and buildings\n$ \n22,126 \n$ \n20,041 \nMachinery, equipment and internal-use software\n \n81,060 \n \n78,659 \nLeasehold improvements\n \n11,271 \n \n11,023 \nGross property, plant and equipment\n \n114,457 \n \n109,723 \nAccumulated depreciation and amortization\n \n(72,340)  \n(70,283) \nTotal property, plant and equipment, net\n$ \n42,117 \n$ \n39,440 \nOther Non-Current Liabilities\n2022\n2021\nLong-term taxes payable\n$ \n16,657 \n$ \n24,689 \nOther non-current liabilities\n \n32,485 \n \n28,636 \nTotal other non-current liabilities\n$ \n49,142 \n$ \n53,325 \nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nThe following table shows the detail of OI&E for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\n2022\n2021\n2020\nInterest and dividend income\n$ \n2,825 \n$ \n2,843 \n$ \n3,763 \nInterest expense\n \n(2,931)  \n(2,645)  \n(2,873) \nOther income/(expense), net\n \n(228)  \n60 \n \n(87) \nTotal other income/(expense), net\n$ \n(334) $ \n258 \n$ \n803 \nNote 5 \u2013 Income Taxes\nProvision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate\nThe provision for income taxes for 2022, 2021 and 2020, consisted of the following (in millions):\n2022\n2021\n2020\nFederal:\nCurrent\n$ \n7,890 \n$ \n8,257 \n$ \n6,306 \nDeferred\n \n(2,265)  \n(7,176)  \n(3,619) \nTotal\n \n5,625 \n \n1,081 \n \n2,687 \nState:\nCurrent\n \n1,519 \n \n1,620 \n \n455 \nDeferred\n \n84 \n \n(338)  \n21 \nTotal\n \n1,603 \n \n1,282 \n \n476 \nForeign:\nCurrent\n \n8,996 \n \n9,424 \n \n3,134 \nDeferred\n \n3,076 \n \n2,740 \n \n3,383 \nTotal\n \n12,072 \n \n12,164 \n \n6,517 \nProvision for income taxes\n$ \n19,300 \n$ \n14,527 \n$ \n9,680 \nThe foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of $71.3 billion, $68.7 billion and $38.1 billion in 2022, \n2021 and 2020, respectively.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 41\n\nA reconciliation of the provision for income taxes to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (21% \nin 2022, 2021 and 2020) to income before provision for income taxes for 2022, 2021 and 2020, is as follows (dollars in millions):\n2022\n2021\n2020\nComputed expected tax\n$ \n25,012 \n$ \n22,933 \n$ \n14,089 \nState taxes, net of federal effect\n \n1,518 \n \n1,151 \n \n423 \nImpacts of the Act\n \n542 \n \n\u2014 \n \n(582) \nEarnings of foreign subsidiaries\n \n(4,366) \n \n(4,715) \n \n(2,534) \nForeign-derived intangible income deduction\n \n(296) \n \n(1,372) \n \n(169) \nResearch and development credit, net\n \n(1,153) \n \n(1,033) \n \n(728) \nExcess tax benefits from equity awards\n \n(1,871) \n \n(2,137) \n \n(930) \nOther\n \n(86) \n \n(300) \n \n111 \nProvision for income taxes\n$ \n19,300 \n$ \n14,527 \n$ \n9,680 \nEffective tax rate\n \n16.2% \n \n13.3% \n \n14.4% \nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nAs of September\u00a0 24, 2022 and September\u00a0 25, 2021, the significant components of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets and \nliabilities were (in millions):\n2022\n2021\nDeferred tax assets:\nAmortization and depreciation\n$ \n1,496 \n$ \n5,575 \nAccrued liabilities and other reserves\n \n6,515 \n \n5,895 \nLease liabilities\n \n2,400 \n \n2,406 \nDeferred revenue\n \n5,742 \n \n5,399 \nUnrealized losses\n \n2,913 \n \n53 \nTax credit carryforwards\n \n6,962 \n \n4,262 \nOther\n \n1,596 \n \n1,639 \nTotal deferred tax assets\n \n27,624 \n \n25,229 \nLess: Valuation allowance\n \n(7,530)  \n(4,903) \nTotal deferred tax assets, net\n \n20,094 \n \n20,326 \nDeferred tax liabilities:\nMinimum tax on foreign earnings\n \n1,983 \n \n4,318 \nRight-of-use assets\n \n2,163 \n \n2,167 \nUnrealized gains\n \n942 \n \n203 \nOther\n \n469 \n \n565 \nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n \n5,557 \n \n7,253 \nNet deferred tax assets\n$ \n14,537 \n$ \n13,073 \nAs of September\u00a0 24, 2022, the Company had $4.4\u00a0 billion in foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland and $2.5\u00a0 billion in \nCalifornia R&D credit carryforwards, both of which can be carried forward indefinitely.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the \nCompany for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated \nthe application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be \u20ac13.1 billion, plus interest of \n\u20ac1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the \nEuropean Union (the \u201cGeneral Court\u201d). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, \n2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court\u2019s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company \nbelieves that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable \nagainst U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.\nOn an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for \ncertain taxes paid to other countries. As of September\u00a0 24, 2022, the adjusted recovery amount was \u20ac12.7 billion, excluding \ninterest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use \npending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan reduce the number of shares available for \ngrant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax \nwithholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2022 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the \nnumber of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (\u201cDERs\u201d), \nwhich entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same \nvesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs.

RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a \nfactor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the \nDirector Plan are entitled to DERs, which are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying \nRSUs.

The Company also competes for various components with \nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in \nAsia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nThe Company has entered into certain off\u2013balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services \n(\u201cunconditional purchase obligations\u201d).

Those standards require that we plan and perform the \naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all \nmaterial respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material \nweakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, \nand performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a \nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the \nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. \ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and \nprocedures that (1)\u00a0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions \nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to \npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts \nand expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the \ncompany; and (3)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, \nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate \nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nOctober\u00a027, 2022\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 52", "page_range": [3, 31], "cross_references": [{"source_text": "Note 1", "target_section": "1", "position": 9721, "context": "e Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasi"}, {"source_text": "Note 9", "target_section": "9", "position": 16679, "context": "egarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, \u201cBenefit Plans.\u201d\nEarnings Per Share\nThe followin"}, {"source_text": "Note 1", "target_section": "1", "position": 23804, "context": "re the same as those described \nelsewhere in this Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nTh"}, {"source_text": "Note 2", "target_section": "2", "position": 24939, "context": "tween segments for management reporting purposes.\nNote 2 \u2013 Revenue\nNet sales disaggregated by significant "}, {"source_text": "Note 11", "target_section": "11", "position": 26420, "context": "erally consistent for each reportable segment \nin Note 11, \u201cSegment Information and Geographic Data\u201d for 20"}, {"source_text": "Note 3", "target_section": "3", "position": 26997, "context": "an three years.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 37\n\nNote 3 \u2013 Financial Instruments\nCash, Cash Equivalents an"}, {"source_text": "Note 5", "target_section": "5", "position": 30530, "context": " use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d) and \nother agreements.\nApple Inc"}, {"source_text": "Note 4", "target_section": "4", "position": 37499, "context": ", 11% \nand 11%.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 40\n\nNote 4 \u2013 Consolidated Financial Statement Details\nThe fo"}, {"source_text": "Note 5", "target_section": "5", "position": 38613, "context": "er income/(expense), net\n$ \n(334) $ \n258 \n$ \n803 \nNote 5 \u2013 Income Taxes\nProvision for Income Taxes and Eff"}, {"source_text": "Note \n3", "target_section": "3", "position": 44870, "context": " Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note \n3, \u201cFinancial Instruments\u201d for more information.\nNo"}, {"source_text": "Note 6", "target_section": "6", "position": 44925, "context": "\n3, \u201cFinancial Instruments\u201d for more information.\nNote 6 \u2013 Leases\nThe Company has lease arrangements for c"}, {"source_text": "Note 7", "target_section": "7", "position": 48122, "context": "ar to 21 years.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 44\n\nNote 7 \u2013 Debt\nCommercial Paper and Repurchase Agreements"}, {"source_text": "Note 8", "target_section": "8", "position": 52045, "context": " $98.8 \nbillion and $125.3 billion, respectively.\nNote 8 \u2013 Shareholders\u2019 Equity\nShare Repurchase Program\nD"}, {"source_text": "Note 9", "target_section": "9", "position": 53041, "context": "alances\n \n15,943,425 \n \n16,426,786 \n \n16,976,763 \nNote 9 \u2013 Benefit Plans\n2022 Employee Stock Plan\nIn the s"}, {"source_text": "Note 10", "target_section": "10", "position": 59856, "context": "nize over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years.\nNote 10 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies\nConcentrations in"}, {"source_text": "Note 11", "target_section": "11", "position": 62451, "context": "d other claims.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 48\n\nNote 11 \u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data\nThe fol"}, {"source_text": "Note 5", "target_section": "5", "position": 67889, "context": "sitions\nDescription of the Matter\nAs discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subjec"}, {"source_text": "Note 5", "target_section": "5", "position": 69919, "context": "closure in relation to \nthese matters included in Note 5 to the financial statements.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LL"}]}

{"section": "ITEM 9A.", "text": "Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, the Company\u2019s principal \nexecutive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as defined \nin Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September\u00a0 24, 2022 to provide reasonable \nassurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is \n(i)\u00a0 recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and \n(ii)\u00a0 accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer and principal \nfinancial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nThe Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of \nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted \naccounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures \nthat:\u00a0\n(i)\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \ndispositions of the Company\u2019s assets;\n(ii)\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial \nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in \naccordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019s management and directors; and\n(iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u2019s \ninternal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can \nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a \ncontrol system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative \nto their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute \nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of \ncontrols in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in \nbusiness conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting \n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the \nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company\u2019s \nassessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September\u00a024, 2022 \nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in \naccordance with GAAP. The Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit \nreport on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022, which were \nidentified in connection with management\u2019s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the \nExchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over \nfinancial reporting.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 53", "page_range": [3, 56], "cross_references": []}

This description is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the Articles, \nBylaws and applicable California law.\nAuthorized Capital Stock\nThe Company\u2019s authorized capital stock consists of 50,400,000,000 shares of Common Stock.\nCommon Stock\nFully Paid and Nonassessable\nAll of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock are fully paid and nonassessable.\nVoting Rights\nThe holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted on by \nsuch holders.

Any amendment of the Bylaws specifying or changing a fixed number of directors or the \nmaximum or minimum number or changing from a fixed to a variable board or vice versa may only be adopted by the \nshareholders; provided, however, that an amendment of the Bylaws or the Articles reducing the fixed number or the \nminimum number of directors to less than five cannot be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption are equal to \nmore than 16 2/3% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.\nExhibit 4.1\n\nAny shareholders\u2019 meeting may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the shares \npresent in person or represented by proxy.\nDividends\nThe holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividends, if any, as may be declared \nfrom time to time by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors in its discretion from funds legally available therefor.\nRight to Receive Liquidation Distributions\nUpon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive \npro rata all assets remaining available for distribution to holders of such shares.\nNo Preemptive or Similar Rights\nCommon Stock has no preemptive or other subscription rights, and there are no conversion rights or \nredemption or sinking fund provisions with respect to such shares of Common Stock.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions of the Articles, Bylaws and California Law\nProvisions of the Articles and Bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential \nchange in control of the Company or change in its management, including transactions in which shareholders might \notherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that its shareholders might otherwise deem to be in their \nbest interests.

or\n\u2022\nmodify any of the above provisions.\nWe and the trustee may, without the consent of any holders, modify or amend the terms of the Indentures \nand any series of Notes with respect to the following:\n\u2022\nto add to our covenants for the benefit of holders of all or any series of the Notes or to surrender any \nright or power conferred upon us;\n\u2022\nto evidence the succession of another person to, and the assumption by the successor of our \ncovenants, agreements and obligations under, the applicable Indenture pursuant to the covenant \ndescribed above under the caption \u201cCovenants\u2014Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets\u201d;\n\u2022\nto add any additional events of default for the benefit of holders of all or any series of the Notes;\n\u2022\nto add one or more guarantees, and in the case of the 2018 Indenture, co-obligors, for the benefit of \nholders of the Notes;\n\u2022\nto secure the Notes pursuant to the covenants of the Indenture;\n\u2022\nto add or appoint a successor or separate trustee or other agent;\n\u2022\nto provide for the issuance of additional debt securities of any series;\n\u2022\nto establish the form or terms of the debt securities of any series as permitted by the Indenture;\n\u2022\nto comply with the rules of any applicable securities depository;\n\u2022\nto provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;\n\u2022\nin the case of the 2013 Indenture, to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of the 2013 \nIndenture in respect of one or more series of debt securities; provided that any such addition, change or \nelimination (a) shall neither (1) apply to any debt security of any series created prior to the execution of \nsuch supplemental indenture and entitled to the benefit of such provision nor (2) modify the rights of the \nholder of any such debt security with respect to such provision or (b) shall become effective only when \nthere is no debt security described in clause (a)(1) outstanding;\n\u2022\nin the case of the 2018 Indenture, to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of the 2018 \nIndenture in respect of one or more series of debt securities; provided that any such addition, change or \nelimination shall become effective only when there is no outstanding security of any series created prior \nto the execution of such supplemental indenture that is entitled to the benefit of such provision and as to \nwhich such supplemental indenture would apply;\n\u2022\nto cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;\n\u2022\nto change any other provision; provided that the change does not adversely affect the interests of the \nholders of debt securities of, in the case of the 2013 Indenture any series, and in the case of the 2018 \nIndenture, any outstanding series, in any material respect;\n\u2022\nto supplement any of the provisions of the applicable Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to \npermit or facilitate the defeasance and discharge of any series of Notes pursuant to the Indenture; \n12\n\nprovided that any such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the holders of Notes of such \nseries or any other series of debt securities in any material respect;\n\u2022\nto comply with the rules or regulations of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on \nwhich any of the Notes may be listed or traded; and\n\u2022\nto add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of the applicable Indenture as shall be necessary or \ndesirable in accordance with any amendments to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and in \nthe case of the 2013 Indenture, provided that such action does not adversely affect the rights or \ninterests of any holder of debt securities in any material respect.\nThe holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of any series may, \non behalf of the holders of all Notes of that series, waive compliance by us with certain restrictive provisions of the \nIndentures. The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of a series \nmay, on behalf of the holders of all Notes of that series, waive any past default and its consequences under the \napplicable Indenture with respect to the Notes of that series, except a default (1) in the payment of principal or \npremium, if any, or interest on Notes of that series or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision of the applicable \nIndenture that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each Note of that series. Upon any \nsuch waiver, such default will cease to exist, and any event of default arising therefrom will be deemed to have been \ncured, for every purpose of the Indenture; however, no such waiver will extend to any subsequent or other default or \nevent of default or impair any rights consequent thereon.\nDischarge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance\nWe may discharge certain obligations to holders of the Notes of a series that have not already been \ndelivered to the trustee for cancellation and that either have become due and payable or will become due and \npayable within one year (or scheduled for redemption within one year) by depositing with the trustee, in trust, funds in \nU.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the entire indebtedness including, but not limited to, the principal and \npremium, if any, and interest to the date of such deposit (if due and payable) or to the maturity thereof or the \nredemption date of the Notes of that series, as the case may be. We may direct the trustee to invest such funds in \nU.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of one year or less or in a money market fund that invests solely in short-term \nU.S. Treasury securities.\nThe Indentures provide that we may elect either (1) to defease and be discharged from any and all \nobligations with respect to the Notes of a series (except for, among other things, obligations to register the transfer or \nexchange of the Notes, to replace temporary or mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, to maintain an office or \nagency with respect to the Notes and to hold moneys for payment in trust) (\u201clegal defeasance\u201d) or (2) to be released \nfrom our obligations to comply with the restrictive covenants under the applicable Indenture, and any omission to \ncomply with such obligations will not constitute a default or an event of default with respect to the Notes of a series \nand clauses (3) and (6) under the caption \u201cEvents of Default\u201d above will no longer be applied (\u201ccovenant \ndefeasance\u201d). Legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, will be conditioned upon, among other \nthings, the irrevocable deposit by us with the trustee, in trust, of an amount in U.S. dollars, or U.S. government \nobligations (as such term is modified below), or both, applicable to the Notes of that series which through the \nscheduled payment of principal and interest in accordance with their terms will provide money in an amount sufficient \nto pay the principal or premium, if any, and interest on the Notes on the scheduled due dates therefor.\nIf we effect covenant defeasance with respect to the Notes of any series, the amount in U.S. dollars, or U.S. \ngovernment obligations (as such term is modified below), or both, on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient, in the \nopinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants, to pay amounts due on the Notes of that series at \nthe time of the stated maturity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the Notes of that series at the time of \nthe acceleration resulting from such event of default. However, we would remain liable to make payment of such \namounts due at the time of acceleration.\nWith respect to the 2022 Notes, the 2024 Notes, the 0.000% 2025 Notes, the 0.875% 2025 Notes, the 2026 \nNotes, the 2027 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes, the term \u201cU.S. government obligations\u201d shall \ninstead mean (x) any security that is (i) a direct obligation of the German government or (ii) an obligation of a person \ncontrolled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the German government the payment of \nwhich is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the German government or the central bank of the German \ngovernment, which, in either case (x)(i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (y) \n13\n\ncertificates, depositary receipts or other instruments which evidence a direct ownership interest in obligations \ndescribed in clause (x)(i) or (x)(ii) above or in any specific principal or interest payments due in respect thereof. \nWith respect to the 3.050% 2029 Notes and the 2042 Notes, the term \u201cU.S. government obligations\u201d shall \ninstead mean (x) any security that is (i) a direct obligation of the United Kingdom government or (ii) an obligation of a \nperson controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United Kingdom government the \npayment of which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the United Kingdom government or the central bank of \nthe United Kingdom government, which, in either case (x)(i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the option of the \nissuer thereof, and (y)\u00a0certificates, depositary receipts or other instruments which evidence a direct ownership interest \nin obligations described in clause (x)(i) or (x)(ii) above or in any specific principal or interest payments due in respect \nthereof. \nWe will be required to deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel that the deposit and related defeasance \nwill not cause the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes of that series to recognize income, gain or loss for \nfederal income tax purposes. If we elect legal defeasance, that opinion of counsel must be based upon a ruling from \nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Service or a change in law to that effect.\nWe may exercise our legal defeasance option notwithstanding our prior exercise of our covenant \ndefeasance option.\nBook-Entry and Settlement\nThe Notes were issued in book-entry form and are represented by global notes deposited with, or on behalf \nof, a common depositary on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream, and are registered in the name of the common \ndepositary or its nominee. Except as described herein, certificated notes will not be issued in exchange for beneficial \ninterests in the global notes.\nCertificated Notes\nSubject to certain conditions, the Notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable for certificated \nnotes in definitive form of like tenor, in minimum denominations of \u20ac100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of \n\u20ac1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the 2022 Notes, the 2024 Notes, the 0.000% 2025 Notes, the 0.875% 2025 \nNotes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes, and in minimum denominations \nof \u00a3100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of \u00a31,000 in excess thereof in the case of the 3.050% 2029 Notes \nand the 2042 Notes, if: \n1.\nthe common depositary notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary or if the \ncommon depositary ceases to be eligible under the applicable Indenture and we do not appoint a \nsuccessor depository within 90 days;\n2. \nwe determine that the Notes will no longer be represented by global securities and execute and deliver \nto the trustee an order to that effect; or\n3. \nan event of default with respect to the Notes will have occurred and be continuing. \nAny Note that is exchangeable as above is exchangeable for certificated notes issuable in authorized \ndenominations and registered in such names as the common depositary shall direct. Subject to the foregoing, a \nglobal note is not exchangeable, except for a global note of the same aggregate denomination to be registered in the \nname of the common depositary or its nominee. \nThe Trustee for the Notes\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. is the trustee under the Indentures. We have \ncommercial deposits and custodial arrangements with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. and its \naffiliates (\u201cBNYM\u201d). We may enter into similar or other banking relationships with BNYM in the future in the normal \ncourse of business. In addition, BNYM acts as trustee and as paying agent with respect to other debt securities \nissued by us, and may do so for future issuances of debt securities by us as well.\n14\n\nExhibit 21.1\nSubsidiaries of\nApple Inc.*\nJurisdiction\nof\u00a0Incorporation\nApple Asia Limited\nHong Kong\nApple Asia LLC\nDelaware, U.S.\nApple Canada Inc.\nCanada\nApple Computer Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.\nChina\nApple Distribution International Limited\nIreland\nApple India Private Limited\nIndia\nApple Insurance Company, Inc.\nArizona, U.S.\nApple Japan, Inc.\nJapan\nApple Korea Limited\nSouth Korea\nApple Operations Europe Limited\nIreland\nApple Operations International Limited\nIreland\nApple Operations Limited\nIreland\nApple Operations Mexico, S.A. de C.V.\nMexico\nApple Pty Limited\nAustralia\nApple Sales International Limited\nIreland\nApple South Asia (Thailand) Limited\nThailand\nApple Vietnam Limited Liability Company\nVietnam\nBraeburn Capital, Inc.\nNevada,\u00a0U.S.\niTunes K.K.\nJapan\n*\nPursuant to Item 601(b)(21)(ii) of Regulation S-K, the names of other subsidiaries of Apple Inc. are omitted because, \nconsidered in the aggregate, they would not constitute a significant subsidiary as of the end of the year covered by this report.\n\nExhibit 23.1\nConsent of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nWe consent to the incorporation by reference in the following Registration Statements:\n(1)\nRegistration Statement (Form S-3 ASR No. 333-260578) of Apple Inc.,\n(2)\nRegistration Statement (Form S-8 No. 333-264555) pertaining to Apple Inc.
