The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical\nsupport, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of\naccidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product.\nCloud Services\nThe Company\u2019s cloud services store and keep customers\u2019 content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers.\nDigital Content\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store , that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as\nbooks, music, video, games and podcasts.\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade , a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+\n, a\npersonalized fitness service; Apple Music , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ , a subscription news\nand magazine service; and Apple TV+ , which offers exclusive original content and live sports.\nPayment Services\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay , a cashless payment service.\nSegments\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China,\nJapan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and\nAfrica. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the\nCompany\u2019s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is\nmanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic\nregion.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Company\u2019s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its\nproducts and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The\nCompany also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023,\nthe Company\u2019s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward\npressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in\nproduct price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and\nbusinesses. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the\nCompany\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\nSM\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2\n\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and\ntechnologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,\nnumerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features\n(including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and\naccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well\nas established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines,\nlower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and\nlowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The\nCompany\u2019s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and\napplications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products, or\ncollaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from\nsingle or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,\ntablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times\nsubject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize\ncustom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the\nsuppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,\nmay be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s\nrequirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or\nrenew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully\ndepends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company\ncontinues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development\n(\u201cR&D\u201d), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and\nservices. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although\nthe Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in\npart on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and\nmarketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and\nregistered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\u2019s products and\nservices. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third\nparties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company\u2019s products, processes and services. While the\nCompany has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be\nobtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3\n\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\nintroductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product\nlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team\nmembers. As of September\u00a030, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company\u2019s success. The\nCompany recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their\nprofessional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and\nresources that are designed to support employees\u2019 individual growth and development.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company\ncontinues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all\nemployees.\nEngagement\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work\nenvironment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or\nconcerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop\nmeasures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific\nprograms in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team\nmembers, visitors and customers through its global security team.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company\u2019s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to\nSections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the \u201cSEC\u201d).

{"section": "ITEM 1A.", "text": "Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known\nor unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of\noperations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should\nnot be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nThis discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can\nmaterially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales. In addition, the Company\u2019s\nglobal supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\u2019s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the\nU.S. As a result, the Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency\nfluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. In\naddition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility,\ndeclines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions\ncan have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel\npartners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties\nand other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company\u2019s financial\ninstruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe Company\u2019s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health\nissues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business\ninterruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers,\nsuppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales, and the Company believes that it\ngenerally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners\nlocated primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on\nimports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and supply chain and limit the Company\u2019s ability to\noffer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions\nwhere the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company\nto take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing\nthe Company\u2019s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the\nCompany\u2019s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse\nimpacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions\nbeing imposed on the Company\u2019s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly\nmore severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international\ndisputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nMany of the Company\u2019s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations\nthat are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power\nshortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks,\nlabor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Global climate\nchange is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense\neffects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in\nthe Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer\nspending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant\nexpenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many\ncritical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company\u2019s suppliers are\nrequired to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to\nthe Company\u2019s business, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have\nadversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer\nproducts; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement\nof products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\u2019s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the\nsupply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\nGlobal markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be\nunable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward\npressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in\nproduct price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and\nbusinesses.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and\ntechnologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,\nnumerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these\ninvestments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6\n\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents,\ntrademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures,\nand by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its\u00a0intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every\ncountry in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if\ncompetitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in\nthese markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital\ncontent supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of\nactive devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have\nthe resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have\nfrom time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products or\ncollaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate\nthe Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Company\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established\nservice offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes\nwith illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company\u2019s ability to continually improve its products and\nservices to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services\nthat compete effectively.\nBusiness Risks\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products\nand services.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new\nproducts, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and\nservices, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions\ndepends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with\nnew technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company\u2019s products, the effective management of purchase\ncommitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet\nanticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will\nsuccessfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are\nlocated outside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan,\nSouth Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often\nin single locations. Changes or additions to the Company\u2019s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce\nthe Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the\nquality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although\narrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the\nconsumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time.\nWhile the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can\nmaterially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7\n\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing\npartners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a\nnegative impact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final\ndestinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes,\narmed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to\ncertain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if\nthese outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or\nterminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many\ncomponents, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing\nfluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor\nindustry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of\ncomponents and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into\nagreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or\nat all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular\nindustry, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or\nregional economic conditions on the Company\u2019s suppliers, described in \u201cThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional\neconomic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition,\u201d\nabove, can also affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price\nincreases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial\ncapacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these\ncomponents at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common\ncomponents instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. When the Company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product\nhas been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\u2019s business,\nresults of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected\ndepending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect\nthe Company\u2019s business and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating\nsystem software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of\nhardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects\ncould make the Company\u2019s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the\nCompany\u2019s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company\u2019s service offerings can have quality issues and from\ntime to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company\u2019s services have not performed as anticipated and may\nnot meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and\nservices it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, the\nCompany can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or\nintangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the\nexperience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market\nacceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8\n\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation\nrisk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds\nnet realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews\nlong-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate\nthe assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the\ncarrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and\npurchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges\ngiven the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase\nobligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u2019s markets\nare volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or\ninsufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or\nat all.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In\naddition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent\ncoverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company\u2019s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property\nrights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.\nBased on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the\nright to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain\nproducts or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and\nservices. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company\u2019s\nproducts. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy\nthe Company\u2019s products.\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers\u2019 perception and\nanalysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company\u2019s products compared to competitors\u2019\nplatforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms.\nThis analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected\nfuture growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\nThe Company\u2019s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade\nsoftware for the Company\u2019s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors\u2019 products with larger\nmarket share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u2019s devices can suffer.\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company\u2019s products\nand operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of\nchange, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in\ndissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company\u2019s products.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 9\n\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue\nthey generate on the App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an\napplication. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal\nand regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the\nApp Store, such as the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject\nto litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company\u2019s business practices, and may in the future result in\nfurther changes. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.\nFuture changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App\nStore, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This\ncould reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company\nretains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition\ncould be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company\u2019s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable\nterms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party\ncontent, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company\u2019s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can\nbe for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some\nthird-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or\nimpossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u2019s\naccess to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices\nwith acceptable usage rules.\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and\nsubscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company\u2019s customers.\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the\nCompany may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license\nsuch solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled\nemployees, including key personnel, and the Company\u2019s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.\nMuch of the Company\u2019s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel,\nincluding its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand\nand competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u2019s key personnel are located. In addition to intense\ncompetition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s culture, reputation and operational flexibility.\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute\nproducts and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to\nconsumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company\u2019s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users\u2019 purchases of the\ndevice. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10\n\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u2019 stores with Company\nemployees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or\nincremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\u2019s products, or uncertainty\nregarding demand for some or all of the Company\u2019s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\u2019s products.\nThe Company\u2019s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures\nor network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses,\nphysical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity\nmeasures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all\neventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company\u2019s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company\u2019s online\nservices, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company\u2019s products. These events could materially adversely\naffect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant\nreputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\nThe Company\u2019s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company\u2019s customers and\nemployees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures\nintended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential\ninformation occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are\nalso exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential\ninformation that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company\u2019s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or\nunauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to\ncompromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the\nCompany\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company\u2019s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships,\nand expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks\nare expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent\ncontrols, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company\u2019s ability to identify, investigate and recover from\nincidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various\nindustries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns,\nmanages, stores and processes.\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of\nsensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies,\nthese security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system\nerror, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 employees or\ncustomers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s or its\nvendors\u2019 systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor\nauthentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can\nresult in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company\u2019s products and services.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient\nto cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11\n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated\nand materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and\nuncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and\nregulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and\nintangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory\napprovals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The\nfailure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company\u2019s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of\noperations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the\nCompany\u2019s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs\nassociated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or\ngovernment investigations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet\nbeen fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions\nwhich can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and\ngovernment investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally\nincreased over time and may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the\nfuture, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents\nand seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is\nvigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions\nfrequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and\ndisruptive to the Company\u2019s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation\nand resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These\nagreements can also significantly increase the Company\u2019s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services.\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, \u201cCommitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations\u201d under the heading \u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of\nmanagement, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual,\nconcerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified\nthird party in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting\nperiod could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages,\ndisgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the\nfuture require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of\nclaims that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12\n\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased\ncosts and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data\nlocalization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership\nand infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film\nand digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign\nexchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti\u2013money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety,\nincluding electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company\u2019s business by\nincreasing the Company\u2019s costs, limiting the Company\u2019s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the\nCompany\u2019s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company\u2019s supply chain\nand its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied.\nThese risks and costs may increase as the Company\u2019s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial\nservices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no\nassurance the Company\u2019s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies and procedures. If the\nCompany is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and\nfinancial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business may be announced with little or no advance\nnotice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing\nregulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy\nregulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a\nresult, the Company\u2019s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business,\nreputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential\nliabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance\nconsiderations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In\naddition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press\nstatements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and\ninitiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company\u2019s control.\nThe Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders\nmay disagree with the Company\u2019s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its\npublic statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied\nstakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes\nthe Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal\nand regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the\nApp Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other jurisdictions. Changes\nhave included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also\naffect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what\nextent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13\n\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims\nagainst the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such\ninvestigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its\nApp Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also\nsubject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company\u2019s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and\nlitigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s commercial relationships with those business partners\nand materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing\narrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company\u2019s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently\nsubject to government investigations and legal proceedings.\nThere can be no assurance the Company\u2019s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such\ninvestigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company\u2019s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations\nor in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company\u2019s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely\naffect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor\nmarket acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various\ntypes of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the\nCompany and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional\nrestrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and\nchanging requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business\npractices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press\nstatements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or\ninternational privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In\naddition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific\nobligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial\ndata are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding\nthe Company\u2019s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data\nis handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company\u2019s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to\nlitigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised,\nthe Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry\ndata security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment\ncards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14\n\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company\u2019s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the\nCompany\u2019s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company\u2019s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure\ndue to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed\nproduct life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering\ncontent for the Company\u2019s services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or\nin the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings;\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or\nservices with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company\ngenerates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The\nCompany could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products or services, issues with new\nproduct or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company\u2019s logistics, components supply,\nor manufacturing partners.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\nThe Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses\nworldwide. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the\npast been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and\nearnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u2019s products. In some circumstances, for\ncompetitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect\nthe U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales.\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and\nearnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit.\nAdditionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely\naffecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign\nexchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable\nmovements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political\nrisk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations\nand financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply\nagreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company\nalso sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the\nCompany\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant\nportion of the Company\u2019s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit and\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has\nunsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or\nassemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of\ninventory components. As of September\u00a030, 2023, the Company\u2019s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were\nconcentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its\ntrade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and\navoid losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries\nare organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be\nsubject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing\ninternational tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of\nearnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes\nin tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and\ngovernmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its\nprovision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate\ndetermination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nGeneral Risks\nThe price of the Company\u2019s stock is subject to volatility.\nThe Company\u2019s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology\nindustry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in\nways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases\nits stock in a given period to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future\ngrowth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow,\nand that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and\nthe Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to\nfuture growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company\u2019s stock may decline significantly, which could\nhave a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention."}

(\u201cEpic\u201d) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the \u201cDistrict Court\u201d) against the Company alleging\nviolations of federal and state antitrust laws and California\u2019s unfair competition law based upon the Company\u2019s operation of its App Store. On September 10,\n2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic\u2019s claim. The District Court found that certain\nprovisions of the Company\u2019s App Store Review Guidelines violate California\u2019s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from\nprohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The\ninjunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the \u201cCircuit\nCourt\u201d) affirmed the District Court\u2019s ruling. On June 7, 2023, the Company and Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision.\nOn June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied both petitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple\u2019s motion to stay enforcement of the injunction\npending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In its complaint, Masimo\nsought a permanent exclusion order prohibiting importation to the United States of certain Apple Watch models that include blood oxygen sensing functionality.\nOn October 26, 2023, the ITC entered a limited exclusion order (the \u201cOrder\u201d) prohibiting importation and sales in the United States of Apple Watch models with\nblood oxygen sensing functionality, which includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The Order will not go into effect until the end of the administrative review\nperiod, which is currently expected to end on December 25, 2023. The Company intends to appeal the Order and seek a stay pending the appeal.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The\nCompany settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting\nperiod for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially\nadversely affected."}

taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions):\n2023\n2022\n2021\nProvision for income

Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign\nearnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes.\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S.\nforeign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3\u00a0billion as of September\u00a030, 2023,\nalong with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return\nprogram over the next 12 months and beyond.\nThe Company\u2019s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations:\nDebt\nAs of September\u00a030, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively\nthe \u201cNotes\u201d), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12\nmonths.\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September\u00a030, 2023, the Company had $6.0\nbillion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.\nLeases\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of\nSeptember\u00a030, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months.\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company\u2019s products and to perform final assembly and testing of\nfinished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September\u00a030, 2023, the\nCompany had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company\u2019s manufacturing purchase\nobligations are primarily noncancelable.\nOther Purchase Obligations\nThe Company\u2019s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product\nmanufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of\nSeptember\u00a030, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months.\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\nAs of September\u00a030, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cAct\u201d) was $22.0\u00a0billion,\nwith $6.5\u00a0billion expected to be paid within 12 months.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24\n\nCapital Return Program\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to\nacquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September\u00a0 30, 2023, the Company\u2019s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to\nincrease its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the Company\u2019s\ndiscussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that\naffect the amounts reported. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Management\nbases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form\nthe basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company\u2019s uncertain tax positions involves\nsignificant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the\nallocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company\u2019s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given\nthat the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company\u2019s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering\nchanging facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s\nexpectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain.\nThe Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires\nsignificant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s\nfinancial condition and operating results.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25"}
{"section": "ITEM 7A.", "text": "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks;\nhowever, they may still impact the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in\ninterest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company\u2019s term debt. To protect\nagainst interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate\u2013sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment\nand term debt portfolios.\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that\nwould result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September\u00a030, 2023 and September\u00a024, 2022 (dollars in millions):\nInterest Rate\nSensitive Instrument\nHypothetical Interest\nRate Increase\nPotential Impact\n2023\n2022\nInvestment portfolio\n100 basis points, all tenors\nDecline in fair value\n$\n3,089\u00a0\n$\n4,022\u00a0\nTerm debt\n100 basis points, all tenors\nIncrease in annual interest expense\n$\n194\u00a0\n$\n201\u00a0\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in\nexchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S.\ndollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate\nrisk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may\nchoose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates.\nThe VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign\ncurrency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum\none-day loss in fair value of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September\u00a030, 2023 and September\u00a024, 2022, respectively. Changes in the Company\u2019s underlying\nforeign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company\u2019s foreign currency\nderivatives.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 26"}

Presentation and Preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of these consolidated financial\nstatements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated\nfinancial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period\u2019s presentation.\nThe Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter\nevery five or six years to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company\u2019s fiscal\nyear 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters,\nmonths and periods refer to the Company\u2019s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nRevenue\nThe Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest.\nCash Equivalents\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are treated as cash equivalents.\nMarketable Securities\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\nInventories\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the Act.\nLeases\nThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data center and retail facilities.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 33\n\nNote 2 \u2013 Revenue\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers.\nControl is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or\nservices are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\u2019s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\u2019s\nServices net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following\ntransfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the\nCompany\u2019s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all\ndistinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine\nSSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance\nobligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\u2019s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices\ncharged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to\nprovide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other\nproducts. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered\nat the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud , Siri  and Maps.\nThe third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled\nwith each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the\nCompany lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\u2019s estimated SSPs. Revenue\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product\nis shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the\nCompany does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of\nthe undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue\nbased on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products,\nincluding evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the\nproduct. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer.\nTherefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application\u2013related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 34\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions):\n2023\n2022\n2021\niPhone \n$\n200,583\u00a0\n$\n205,489\u00a0\n$\n191,973\u00a0\nMac \n29,357\u00a0\n40,177\u00a0\n35,190\u00a0\niPad \n28,300\u00a0\n29,292\u00a0\n31,862\u00a0\nWearables, Home and Accessories \n39,845\u00a0\n41,241\u00a0\n38,367\u00a0\nServices \n85,200\u00a0\n78,129\u00a0\n68,425\u00a0\nTotal net sales\n$\n383,285\u00a0\n$\n394,328\u00a0\n$\n365,817\u00a0\n(1)\nProducts net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective\nproduct.\n(2)\nServices net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.\nTotal net sales include $8.2 billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\u00a024, 2022, $7.5 billion of revenue\nrecognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\u00a0 25, 2021, and $6.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2021 that was included in\ndeferred revenue as of September\u00a026, 2020.\nThe Company\u2019s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 13, \u201cSegment\nInformation and Geographic Data\u201d for 2023, 2022 and 2021, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net\nsales.\nAs of September\u00a030, 2023 and September\u00a024, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.1 billion and $12.4\u00a0billion, respectively.

The Company classifies marketable debt\nsecurities as either current or non-current based solely on each instrument\u2019s underlying contractual maturity date.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may\nchoose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\nexposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or\ninterest rates.\nThe Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being\nhedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these\ninstruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory\npurchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nTo protect the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use\nforwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September\u00a030,\n2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt\u2013related foreign currency\ntransactions is 19 years.\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign\nexchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities\ndenominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company\u2019s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other\ninstruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Company\u2019s outstanding derivative instruments as of September\u00a030, 2023 and September\u00a024, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\n2023\n2022\nDerivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts\n$\n74,730\u00a0\n$\n102,670\u00a0\nInterest rate contracts\n$\n19,375\u00a0\n$\n20,125\u00a0\nDerivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts\n$\n104,777\u00a0\n$\n185,381\u00a0\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 37\n\nThe gross fair values of the Company\u2019s derivative assets and liabilities as of September\u00a024, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\n2022\nFair Value of\nDerivatives Designated\nas Accounting Hedges\nFair Value of\nDerivatives Not Designated\nas Accounting Hedges\nTotal\nFair Value\nDerivative assets :\nForeign exchange contracts\n$\n4,317\u00a0\n$\n2,819\u00a0\n$\n7,136\u00a0\nDerivative liabilities :\nForeign exchange contracts\n$\n2,205\u00a0\n$\n2,547\u00a0\n$\n4,752\u00a0\nInterest rate contracts\n$\n1,367\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\n$\n1,367\u00a0\n(1)\nDerivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet.\n(2)\nDerivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet.\nThe derivative assets above represent the Company\u2019s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally\nuses collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from\ncontractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally uses master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to\nthe Company\u2019s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other.

The State Aid Decision ordered\nIreland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of\nJanuary 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be \u20ac13.1 billion, plus interest of \u20ac1.2\nbillion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \u201cGeneral Court\u201d). On\nJuly 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court\u2019s decision to\nthe European Court of Justice (the \u201cECJ\u201d) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024. The Company\nbelieves it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid\nDecision.\nOn an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other\ncountries. As of September\u00a030, 2023, the adjusted recovery amount was \u20ac12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded\ninto escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

RSUs granted under\nthe 2022 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company\u2019s common stock on a\none-for-one basis. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights, which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as\nholders of common stock.

The Company\u2019s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and\ndistribution rights. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September\u00a030,\n2023, are as follows (in millions):\n2024\n$\n4,258\u00a0\n2025\n2,674\u00a0\n2026\n3,434\u00a0\n2027\n1,277\u00a0\n2028\n5,878\u00a0\nThereafter\n3,215\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n20,736\u00a0\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The\noutcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a\nmaterial loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from\nsingle or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,\ntablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times\nsubject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize\ncustom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the\nsuppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,\nmay be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s\nrequirements.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South\nKorea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 46\n\nNote 13 \u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China,\nJapan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and\nAfrica. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the\nCompany\u2019s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is\nmanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic\nregion.\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally\nbased on the location of customers and sales through the Company\u2019s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment\nconsists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. The information provided to the\nCompany\u2019s chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions and assessing segment performance excludes asset information.\nThe following table shows information by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions):\n2023\n2022\n2021\nAmericas:\nNet sales\n$\n162,560\u00a0\n$\n169,658\u00a0\n$\n153,306\u00a0\nOperating income\n$\n60,508\u00a0\n$\n62,683\u00a0\n$\n53,382\u00a0\nEurope:\nNet sales\n$\n94,294\u00a0\n$\n95,118\u00a0\n$\n89,307\u00a0\nOperating income\n$\n36,098\u00a0\n$\n35,233\u00a0\n$\n32,505\u00a0\nGreater China:\nNet sales\n$\n72,559\u00a0\n$\n74,200\u00a0\n$\n68,366\u00a0\nOperating income\n$\n30,328\u00a0\n$\n31,153\u00a0\n$\n28,504\u00a0\nJapan:\nNet sales\n$\n24,257\u00a0\n$\n25,977\u00a0\n$\n28,482\u00a0\nOperating income\n$\n11,888\u00a0\n$\n12,257\u00a0\n$\n12,798\u00a0\nRest of Asia Pacific:\nNet sales\n$\n29,615\u00a0\n$\n29,375\u00a0\n$\n26,356\u00a0\nOperating income\n$\n12,066\u00a0\n$\n11,569\u00a0\n$\n9,817\u00a0\nA reconciliation of the Company\u2019s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (in millions):\n2023\n2022\n2021\nSegment operating income\n$\n150,888\u00a0\n$\n152,895\u00a0\n$\n137,006\u00a0\nResearch and development expense\n(29,915)\n(26,251)\n(21,914)\nOther corporate expenses, net \n(6,672)\n(7,207)\n(6,143)\nTotal operating income\n$\n114,301\u00a0\n$\n119,437\u00a0\n$\n108,949\u00a0\n(1)\nIncludes corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general\nand administrative costs.\n(1)\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 47\n\nThe U.S. and China were the only countries that accounted for more than 10% of the Company\u2019s net sales in 2023, 2022 and 2021.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of Apple Inc. at September\u00a030, 2023 and September\u00a024, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended September\u00a030, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d), Apple Inc.\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of September\u00a030, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November\u00a02, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.\u2019s financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating\nthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to\nbe communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\u00a0 relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)\u00a0 involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccount or disclosure to which it relates.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nDescription of the Matter\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in\nthe U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September\u00a030, 2023, the total amount of\ngross unrecognized tax benefits was $19.5 billion, of which $9.5 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.\u2019s\neffective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the\ninterpretation and application of complex domestic and international tax laws.\nAuditing management\u2019s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and\nthe measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based\non interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 49\n\nHow We Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit\nWe tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management\u2019s\nassessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management\u2019s process to\nmeasure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures.\nTo evaluate Apple Inc.\u2019s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, our audit\nprocedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management\u2019s assumptions and analysis, and, as\napplicable, Apple Inc.\u2019s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the\nuncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of\nApple Inc.\u2019s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing\nauthorities. For certain tax positions, we also received external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the\nmatters with external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.\u2019s disclosure in\nrelation to these matters included in Note 7 to the financial statements.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as Apple Inc.\u2019s auditor since 2009.\nSan Jose, California\nNovember\u00a02, 2023\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 50\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Apple Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of September\u00a030, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the \u201cCOSO criteria\u201d).

Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on Apple Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and\nare required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered\nnecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)\u00a0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\nof financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nNovember\u00a02, 2023\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 51"}

The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that:\u00a0\n(i)\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company\u2019s\nassets;\n(ii)\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\nGAAP, and that the Company\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019s management\nand directors; and\n(iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets\nthat could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u2019s internal controls will prevent or\ndetect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of\ncontrols must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide\nabsolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future\nperiods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)\nunder the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the\ncriteria set forth in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013\nframework).

Each of the Indentures provides that if an event of default occurs and is\ncontinuing, the trustee will exercise such of its rights and powers under such Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent\nperson would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person\u2019s own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the trustee will be under no\nobligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the applicable Indenture at the request of any of the holders of the debt securities of a series unless they\nwill have offered to the trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in\ncompliance with such request.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of any debt security will have an absolute and unconditional right to receive payment of the principal of and\npremium, if any, and interest on that debt security on or after the due dates expressed in that debt security and to institute suit for the enforcement of payment.\nModification and Waivers\nModification and amendments of the Indentures and the Notes may be made by us and the trustee with the consent of the holders of not less than a\nmajority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding series of Notes affected thereby;

and\n\u2022\nto add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of the applicable Indenture as shall be necessary or desirable in accordance with any\namendments to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and in the case of the 2013 Indenture, provided that such action does not adversely\naffect the rights or interests of any holder of debt securities in any material respect.\n12\n\nThe holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of any series may, on behalf of the holders of all Notes of that\nseries, waive compliance by us with certain restrictive provisions of the Indentures. The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the\noutstanding Notes of a series may, on behalf of the holders of all Notes of that series, waive any past default and its consequences under the applicable\nIndenture with respect to the Notes of that series, except a default (1) in the payment of principal or premium, if any, or interest on Notes of that series or (2) in\nrespect of a covenant or provision of the applicable Indenture that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each Note of that series.\nUpon any such waiver, such default will cease to exist, and any event of default arising therefrom will be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of the\nIndenture; however, no such waiver will extend to any subsequent or other default or event of default or impair any rights consequent thereon.\nDischarge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance\nWe may discharge certain obligations to holders of the Notes of a series that have not already been delivered to the trustee for cancellation and that\neither have become due and payable or will become due and payable within one year (or scheduled for redemption within one year) by depositing with the\ntrustee, in trust, funds in U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the entire indebtedness including, but not limited to, the principal and premium, if any, and\ninterest to the date of such deposit (if due and payable) or to the maturity thereof or the redemption date of the Notes of that series, as the case may be. We may\ndirect the trustee to invest such funds in U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of one year or less or in a money market fund that invests solely in short-term\nU.S. Treasury securities.\nThe Indentures provide that we may elect either (1) to defease and be discharged from any and all obligations with respect to the Notes of a series\n(except for, among other things, obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the Notes, to replace temporary or mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes,\nto maintain an office or agency with respect to the Notes and to hold moneys for payment in trust) (\u201clegal defeasance\u201d) or (2) to be released from our obligations\nto comply with the restrictive covenants under the applicable Indenture, and any omission to comply with such obligations will not constitute a default or an event\nof default with respect to the Notes of a series and clauses (3) and (6) under the caption \u201cEvents of Default\u201d above will no longer be applied (\u201ccovenant\ndefeasance\u201d). Legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, will be conditioned upon, among other things, the irrevocable deposit by us with\nthe trustee, in trust, of an amount in U.S. dollars, or U.S. government obligations (as such term is modified below), or both, applicable to the Notes of that series\nwhich through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in accordance with their terms will provide money in an amount sufficient to pay the principal or\npremium, if any, and interest on the Notes on the scheduled due dates therefor.\nIf we effect covenant defeasance with respect to the Notes of any series, the amount in U.S. dollars, or U.S. government obligations (as such term is\nmodified below), or both, on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants, to pay amounts\ndue on the Notes of that series at the time of the stated maturity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the Notes of that series at the time of the\nacceleration resulting from such event of default. However, we would remain liable to make payment of such amounts due at the time of acceleration.\nWith respect to the 2024 Notes, the 0.000% 2025 Notes, the 0.875% 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the\n2031 Notes, the term \u201cU.S. government obligations\u201d shall instead mean (x) any security that is (i) a direct obligation of the German government or (ii) an\nobligation of a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the German government the payment of which is fully and\nunconditionally guaranteed by the German government or the central bank of the German government, which, in either case (x)(i) or (ii), is not callable or\nredeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (y) certificates, depositary receipts or other instruments which evidence a direct ownership interest in\nobligations described in clause (x)(i) or (x)(ii) above or in any specific principal or interest payments due in respect thereof.\nWith respect to the 3.050% 2029 Notes and the 2042 Notes, the term \u201cU.S. government obligations\u201d shall instead mean (x) any security that is (i) a\ndirect obligation of the United Kingdom government or (ii) an obligation of a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the\nUnited Kingdom government the payment of which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the United Kingdom government or the central bank of the United\nKingdom government, which, in either case (x)(i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (y)\u00a0certificates, depositary receipts\nor other instruments which evidence a direct ownership interest in obligations described in clause (x)(i) or (x)(ii) above or in any specific principal or interest\npayments due in respect thereof.\n13\n\nWe will be required to deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel that the deposit and related defeasance will not cause the holders and beneficial\nowners of the Notes of that series to recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes. If we elect legal defeasance, that opinion of counsel must\nbe based upon a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or a change in law to that effect.\nWe may exercise our legal defeasance option notwithstanding our prior exercise of our covenant defeasance option.\nBook-Entry and Settlement\nThe Notes were issued in book-entry form and are represented by global notes deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary on behalf of\nEuroclear and Clearstream, and are registered in the name of the common depositary or its nominee. Except as described herein, certificated notes will not be\nissued in exchange for beneficial interests in the global notes.\nCertificated Notes\nSubject to certain conditions, the Notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable for certificated notes in definitive form of like tenor, in\nminimum denominations of \u20ac100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of \u20ac1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the 2024 Notes, the 0.000% 2025 Notes,\nthe 0.875% 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes, and in minimum denominations of \u00a3100,000 principal\namount and integral multiples of \u00a31,000 in excess thereof in the case of the 3.050% 2029 Notes and the 2042 Notes, if:\n1.\nthe common depositary notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary or if the common depositary ceases to be eligible under\nthe applicable Indenture and we do not appoint a successor depository within 90 days;\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we determine that the Notes will no longer be represented by global securities and execute and deliver to the trustee an order to that effect; or\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0an event of default with respect to the Notes will have occurred and be continuing.\nAny Note that is exchangeable as above is exchangeable for certificated notes issuable in authorized denominations and registered in such names as\nthe common depositary shall direct. Subject to the foregoing, a global note is not exchangeable, except for a global note of the same aggregate denomination to\nbe registered in the name of the common depositary or its nominee.\nThe Trustee for the Notes\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. is the trustee under the Indentures. We have commercial deposits and custodial arrangements with\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. and its affiliates (\u201cBNYM\u201d). We may enter into similar or other banking relationships with BNYM in the future\nin the normal course of business. In addition, BNYM acts as trustee and as paying agent with respect to other debt securities issued by us, and may do so for\nfuture issuances of debt securities by us as well.\n14\n\nExhibit 21.1\nSubsidiaries of\nApple Inc.*\nJurisdiction\nof\u00a0Incorporation\nApple Asia Limited\nHong Kong\nApple Asia LLC\nDelaware, U.S.\nApple Canada Inc.\nCanada\nApple Computer Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.\nChina\nApple Distribution International Limited\nIreland\nApple India Private Limited\nIndia\nApple Insurance Company, Inc.\nArizona, U.S.\nApple Japan, Inc.\nJapan\nApple Korea Limited\nSouth Korea\nApple Operations International Limited\nIreland\nApple Operations Limited\nIreland\nApple Operations Mexico, S.A. de C.V.\nMexico\nApple Pty Limited\nAustralia\nApple Sales International Limited\nIreland\nApple South Asia (Thailand) Limited\nThailand\nApple Vietnam Limited Liability Company\nVietnam\nBraeburn Capital, Inc.\nNevada,\u00a0U.S.\niTunes K.K.\nJapan\n*\nPursuant to Item 601(b)(21)(ii) of Regulation S-K, the names of other subsidiaries of Apple Inc. are omitted because, considered in the aggregate, they would\nnot constitute a significant subsidiary as of the end of the year covered by this report.\n\nExhibit 23.1\nConsent of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nWe consent to the incorporation by reference in the following Registration Statements:\n(1)\nRegistration Statement (Form S-3 ASR No. 333-260578) of Apple Inc.,\n(2)\nRegistration Statement (Form S-8 No. 333-264555) pertaining to Apple Inc.
