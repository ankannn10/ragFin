,Cash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and
subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and,
time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the,
hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the,
amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.,
